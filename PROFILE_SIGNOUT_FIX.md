# Profile Screen - Sign Out Implementation

## ✅ **FIXED ISSUES:**

### 1. **Removed Username Field** ❌➡️✅
- **Problem**: Username field was still showing in the profile screen
- **Root Cause**: I was editing the wrong file (`profile_screen_new.dart` instead of `profile_screen.dart`)
- **Solution**: Removed the username field from the correct file (`lib/screens/profile_screen.dart`)

### 2. **Added Sign Out Functionality** ➕✅
- **Feature**: Added "Sign Out" button in Account Actions section
- **Implementation**: 
  - Confirmation dialog before signing out
  - Clears all stored authentication data using `TokenService.clearStorage()`
  - Navigates to `AuthWrapper()` which automatically shows `LoginScreen()`

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### Profile Screen Structure (Updated):
```
Account Information:
├── First Name (editable)
├── Last Name (editable)  
├── Phone Number (read-only)
└── User ID (read-only)

Account Actions:
├── Change Password 🔒
└── Sign Out 🚪 (NEW)

Account Details:
├── Member Since
└── Last Updated
```

### Sign Out Flow:
1. User clicks "Sign Out" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. If confirmed:
   - `TokenService.clearStorage()` clears all auth data
   - Navigates to `AuthWrapper()` with `pushAndRemoveUntil()`
   - `AuthWrapper` checks auth status and shows `LoginScreen()`

## 🎯 **Key Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart` ✅ (Correct file)
  - Removed username field display
  - Added sign out button and method
  - Added AuthWrapper import for navigation

## 🔄 **Navigation Strategy:**
Instead of navigating to a named route (`/login`), the app now:
- Navigates to `AuthWrapper()` 
- `AuthWrapper` automatically checks authentication status
- Since token is cleared, it shows `LoginScreen()`
- Uses `pushAndRemoveUntil()` to clear navigation stack

## ✅ **Current Status:**
- ❌ Username field removed from display
- ✅ Sign out button added and functional  
- ✅ Proper navigation to login screen after sign out
- ✅ Authentication state properly cleared

The profile screen is now complete with proper sign out functionality!
